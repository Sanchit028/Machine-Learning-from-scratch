# Machine-Learning-from-scratch

This repository provides a collection basic of machine learning algorithms implementation using SKLearn and also from scratch using Python. It is designed to offer a clear understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood. By avoiding any third-party machine learning libraries, the code focuses on fundamental concepts and techniques, making it ideal for students, educators, and machine learning enthusiasts who want to deepen their knowledge.

## Features
#### Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- Single Variable Linear Regression
- Multi-Variable Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Fold Cross Validation

#### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

#### Neural Networks:
- Perceptron

#### Optimization Algorithms: Gradient Descent

#### Utility Functions:
- Data preprocessing (normalization, standardization)
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
- Train-test split
